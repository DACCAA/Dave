# Dave
Dave is DACCAA's Virtual Assistant. You will find within `commands.json` and `response.json` DACCAA Dave's cognative abilities.

## Commands
Commands are all the commands that DACCAA's Dave will understand. It then takes away an intention `response` and hands that over to the `response.json` file, where the `response` will match one of the responses.

## Responses
Responses are all the different ways that DACCAA's Dave can respond to an input.
